### Sandhya Sharma

I am more of a listener.

Detail-oriented and like to follow directions.  

A thinker rather than a talker.

Organized, okay with numbers and data, not very comfortable with stats.

I am okay with creating slides.

I can handle criticism.

I have not served as a tech lead or a project manager and I do not work in IT currently.

I don't have any experience working with APIs and will need some refresher on MVC.

I can speak more than one language.
